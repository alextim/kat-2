# Contacts

<br />

## How to find us:

We are located in the Odessa region, in the Tarutinsky district, 6.5 km from the villages of Staroselye and Veselaya Dolina, 180-220 km from Odessa. The village of Staroselye can be reached by public transport on the bus Odessa-Staroselye, which leaves from the bus station "Odessa-Privoz" (the bus schedule can be checked on the website [bus.com.ua](http://bus.com.ua/).

But itâ€™s more convenient to get to us by personal transport.

## Legend of the route in dry weather:

Odessa - Mayaki - Monashi - at the entrance to Sarata, in front of the traffic police Gai to the right to Faraonovka - Negrovo - Faraonovka - Petropavlovka - after 1.5 km, before reaching the farms, left downhill to Staroselye - from the bus stop to the right - along the dam downhill to Semisotka village - through the farm straight along the line of pillars forward to the dome of the Frumushika Nova church.  
<br />

## Legend of the route in rain and snow:

Odessa - Sarata - Artsiz - Tarutino - Berezino (at the turn of the main road to the left at 90 degrees - you are RIGHT, to the left and through the crossing) - Veselaya Dolina - from the bus stop over the bridge along the main road directly, a monument remains on the right, and ONLY right along this the road outside the village, along the gravel road to the concrete pillar RIGHT, and to the right to us.
