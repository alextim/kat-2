# Contacts

<br />

## How to find us:

We are located in the Odessa region, in the Tarutinsky district, 6.5 km from the villages of Staroselye and Veselaya Dolina, 180-220 km from Odessa. You can get to the Staroselye village by public transport on the bus Odessa-Staroselye, which departs from the bus station "Odessa-Privoz" (the bus schedule can be checked on the website [bus.com.ua](http://bus.com.ua/).

But itâ€™s more convenient to get to us by personal transport.
