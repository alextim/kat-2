        Welcome to the web-page of the "Tarutino Steppe" Natural Ethnographic Park! Our goal is to show you and preserve for posterity the unique nature and culture of the Tarutino steppe - one of the last untouched steppe plots of Ukraine and Europe. You can see how the steppes of our country looked hundreds of years ago, before they were mastered by man and turned into agricultural land.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the unique carpet of vegetation, insects, birds and small animals of the steppe, in the Tarutino steppe you can meet large herbivores that once inhabited the steppe - wild kulans, shy fallow deer, amusing saigas, smart water buffaloes, noble red deer and majestic Ukrainian gray bulls, which roam free in the steppe and shape its landscape and diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the cultural heritage of this region is extremely interesting and rich - from the mounds of the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians, to the houses and traditions of different nationalities who lived on these lands later on - Ukrainians, Russians, Moldavians, Germans and others. Unfortunately, the modern history of the steppe is rather dramatic. Several years ago, the threat of destruction hung over the Tarutino steppe, and only an active public campaign made it possible to preserve this unique territory, although a third of the steppe was plowed and now needs to be restored. 
      </p>

        By visiting the park, you can learn about all these and see all the beauty and riches of the steppe with your own eyes. Check the "Services" page to find the most interesting leisure option in our park.
