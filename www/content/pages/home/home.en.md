        Welcome to the page of the “Tarutino Steppe” Natural Ethnographic Park! Our goal is to show you and preserve for posterity the unique nature and culture of the Tarutino steppe - one of the last preserved in its original form steppe plots of Ukraine and Europe. You can see how the steppes of our country looked hundreds of years ago, before they were mastered by man and turned into agricultural land. In addition to the unique carpet of vegetation inherent in the steppes of insects, birds and small animals, in the Tarutino steppe you can meet once inhabited by the steppes of large herbivores - wild kulans, timid fallow deer, amusing saigas and stately Ukrainian gray bulls that roam the steppe and form its landscape and variety. In addition, the cultural heritage of this region is interesting - from the mounds of the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians, to the dwellings and traditions of different nationalities that lived on these lands subsequently.
