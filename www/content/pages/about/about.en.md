      <p>
        The Tarutino Steppe Natural Ethnographic Park was created in 2020 by teams of enthusiasts of two public organizations - the environmental organization "Rewilding Ukraine" and the regional development organization "Center of Regional Studies", with the support of local communities and businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The park is located in Tarutinsky district of Odessa region and includes two main components: the natural core - a landscape reserve of local importance, and the ethno-touristic component - the center of ethnographic green tourism and family recreation Frumushika Nova." The total area of the park is 6,800 ha, including 5,200 ha of the landscape reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main objectives of the park are to popularize the idea of preserving the steppe ecosystems and the rational use of their resources, providing visitors with the opportunity to communicate with nature, familiarizing themselves with the history and multinational culture of Bessarabia, maintaining historically established local types of nature management and crafts, and creating favorable
        conditions for the restoration of the unique ecosystem of the Tarutino steppe in all its diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reserve is located on the territory of the former Tarutino military training ground and since its creation in 1946 till recent years has never been plowed up, and some sections of the virgin steppe have not known the plow for hundreds of years. This allowed to preserve the natural wealth of the steppe, its flora and fauna.

        text: |
          In 2016, the reserve was threatened with the destruction of steppe ecosystems as a result of illegal plowing. About a quarter of the reserveâ€™s area has been plowed and needs to be restored. The campaign in defense of the reserve, conducted in 2016 by Ukrainian and international environmental organizations and the environmental community, stopped agricultural works on its territory and preserved a unique natural site for future generations.

          In 2020, as part of the rewilding initiative in the Danube Delta, the restoration of the plowed territories of the reserve began. Also, in cooperation with the project "Improving the competitiveness of rural peripheral communities in the south of Odessa region", a program was launched to return (reintroduce) large herbivores to the Tarutino steppe: in the summer, 20 kulans and 8 fallow deers of were brought to the fenced area of the steppe from the "Askania-Nova" biosphere reserve. Later, they were joined by another groups of kulans and fallow deer, as well as saigas, red deer, water buffaloes and Ukrainian gray cattle. In addition, the steppe crane and the marmot are returning to the steppe by joint efforts.

        text: |
          The restoration of nature, the return of wild animals and rewilding can bring economic benefits, create new business opportunities, jobs and sources of income for local communities. The natural ethnographic park Tarutino Steppe is one such example. Similar eco-parks are created in other restored areas in the Danube Delta - the Ermakov island, Lake Kartal, on the Stentsovsko-Zhebriyanovsky ridge. The promotion of these and other rewilding areas as tourist locations in Europe is facilitated by the "European Safari Company". In Ukraine, they are united under the umbrella of Danube Delta brand.
