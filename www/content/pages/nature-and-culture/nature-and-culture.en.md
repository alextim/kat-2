      Tarutino steppe is of great value as the second largest after the biosphere reserve "Askania-Nova" steppe area, preserved in a close to natural state. Today it is unique not only for Ukraine - a country with one of the highest rates of plowed territory in the world - but for Europe as a whole. The Tarutino steppe is recognized as an object of the Emerald Network of Europe, and its preservation is an international obligation of Ukraine in accordance with the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.

          The flora of the Tarutino steppe is especially diverse: there are 527 species of flowering plants here. The greatest value in the park is represented by the ecosystems of mixed-grass-feathergrass virgin and secondary steppes preserved here. There is also an endemic of the north-western Black Sea coast - mountain ash.

          The fauna of the steppe is also rich. It is home to 10 species of amphibians and reptiles, 19 species of mammals, about 100 species of birds. Tarutino steppe is almost the last place in Ukraine where there is a rare species of mammal - steppe mouse. The Tarutino steppe is of great importance for the preservation of rare species of steppe birds. As early as the middle of the last century, bustards and steppe cranes nested in the Tarutino steppe. More than 17 species of plants and about 40 species of animals living here are listed in the Red Book of Ukraine and the European Red List of Endangered Species.

      - title: Large herbivores
        text: |
          Large herbivores play an important role in natural systems. They support natural meadows and steppes, promote the growth of grasses and trees, and can even open closed forests. Much of Europe's biodiversity is inhabited by open meadows, mosaic landscapes and forest-steppes, open forests and groves, all of which depend on herbivores to survive. When large natural areas are abandoned by humans and herbivores, they are overgrown with shrubs and forests, so their biodiversity is reduced.
          We return local herbivores to the land where they once lived. Here in the park you can see wild kulans, timid deer, funny saigas and majestic Ukrainian gray bulls that roam the Tarutino steppe and form its landscape and diversity.

          This region has long been one of the ethnocultural ¬´crossroads¬ª of Europe. Here are the mounds indicating the presence of the Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, etc. Up to the Polovtsy, Pechenegs and Nogais. In the Middle Ages, the Budzhak lands belonged to many powers: Bulgaria, Kievan Rus, the Galicia-Volyn Principality, and Moldova.

          At the end of the eighteenth century. Russian Old Believers, Moldavian peasants and Ukrainian Cossacks begin to penetrate into this region. In 1812, in the Bucharest world, Budzhak departs from the Russian Empire. The Nogais were evicted, and their tracts were settled by state peasants (Ukrainians, Moldavians, Russians) and ‚Äúforeign colonists‚Äù (Germans, Bulgarians, Gagauzians). After the war, in 1946, at the initiative of G.K. Zhukov, the population of the villages on the border of the Saratsky and Tarutinsky regions was evicted, and the territory itself was turned into an artillery range.
