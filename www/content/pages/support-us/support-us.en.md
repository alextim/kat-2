We continue to restore the steppe, develop a natural and ethnographic park and popularize the ideas of nature conservation and preservation of the cultural heritage of our region, and also we try to protect the reintroduced animals from various threats, for example, in winter or in the dry season they may need help and feeding. We and kulans ðŸ˜‰ will be grateful to you for any charitable donation to support and develop the park.
